# Warehouse-Inventory-GDP-2

##Introduction

The main objective of a warehouse inventory is to ensure that there is a constant supply of goods or raw materials to meet orders that you have without creating excess inventory. Warehouse inventory is a subset of inventory management and is focused on knowing which products are incoming and outgoing, as well as where each item is located.
##Scope
The WIS is responsible for maintaining registered items, their quantities and alarming the manager and admin at lower stock. Moreover, it will be able to have a good check and balance in all branches associated with this system. This system will be a great deal for the owner and his/her customers and worker to perform their jobs in a very efficient way. This will be applicable to all stores having daily lifeâ€™s needed items; thus it is a generic system.
#General Description
##	Product Perspective
Warehouse inventory software offers several key features to help you monitor the goods within your storage facilities and oversee inventory control. In some cases, warehouse inventory software is built into broader enterprise resource planning (ERP) software solutions; in other cases, warehouse inventory software serves as a stand-alone system. It is best to purchase a seamlessly integrated process if you want to manage your inventory across the entire ecosystem of your company. Inventory management software covers the acquisition, tracking, and shipping of products, ensuring you know what products are where at what time. They can also serve as forecasting tools, helping you to order items based on expected customer demand according to historical sales data. Some also offer alerts and notifications to improve the operational process of your warehouse, indicating when it is time to perform cycle counts.				
##	Product Functions		
Every warehouse moves things, stores them, keeps track of them, and sends them out regardless of the product. Our four primary types of equipment are storage, material handling, packing, and shipping, and barcode equipment as a result of these four activities.
